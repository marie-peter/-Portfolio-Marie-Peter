                    <p>
                        Dog owners need a way to:

                                <li>Have fun while walking their dog, at least twice a day</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                        And also to:

                                <li>Keep track of their dog's activity and health agenda</li>
                                <li>Prevent boredom and disruptive behaviours</li>

                    <h3>User Research and on-field interviews</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a journalist for 20 years, I'm used to engage with people in the streets. My target audience being dog-owners, conducting ethnographic-style research in the user’s natural environment was obviously easy.
                        <br>
                        As a start, I spent time in dog parks, observing people and peeking at their phone screens. Many of them where scrolling on social medias or doing online shopping while watching over their dog playing. Then, I prepared an interview script and asked a few dozen of dog-owners if they'd agree to answer. It was fairly easy, as they love talking about their four-legged better half. I always introduced myself as a UX Designer, explained my project, informed them about the use of the data I would extract and asked them to sign a consent form. They offered me bulk information, very precious at a this early stage of my concept, about their daily dog-routine, their consumption habits, needs, demographics, digital profile, as well as the online or real-life communities they belong to, etc.
                        <br>
                        1 primary persona and 3 secondary personas emerged.

                    <h3>Information architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the interviews, I asked: "How fun is it to walk your dog?" 
                        <br>
                        Some admitted that walking their dog isn't always the best part of their day. Nevertheless, they would walk their dog diligently because they keep focus on their ulterior motives:
                        <ul>
                             <li>Complying with the social needs of their dog (parenting)</li>
                             <li>Deepening their bond with their dog (caring)</li>
                             <li>Being outside and having some physical activity (health)</li>
                             <li>Talking with other dog-lovers and exchanging advices (community)</li>
                             <li> Not missing good deals (saving money)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Thanks to this results, I decided to focus on 5 core features: 
                        <ul>
                              <li>Walk planning and history</li>
                              <li>Health</li>
                              <li>Chat</li>
                              <li>Find professionals</li>
                              <li>Rewards</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        At this stage of the development of my concept, Pup had already evolved. The application was still meant to provide the extra boost of motivation to the users, in order to solve the initial problem stated above.

                    <h3>Wireframes and Mid-fidelity Prototype</h3>
                    <p>
                        After wireframing with Balsamiq, I designed a clickable mid-fidelity prototype with Sketch. I did my best to create a light, bright and usable interface. Users could:
                        <ul>
                             <li>Adjust duration</li>
                             <li>Define location</li>
                             <li>Adding or removing a stop at will</li>
                             <li>Be visible/invisible on a map if the users want/don't want to connect with others</li>
                        </ul>
                        All that was meant to give more freedom and empower users with the perfect choice. 
                        <br>But... 
                        <br>My plans were crushed the minute I started to test the clickable prototype. One tester asked commented: <strong> My dog is waiting at the door, all excited, and I have to go through all this scheduling process??? That doesn't make any sense!</strong>
                        <br>I'm trully gratefull to her. It would have been so sad to realize that after realising a MVP!

                    <h3>Usability tests​​​​​​​</h3>
                    <p>
                        6 persons agreed to test my prototype while being recorded and to answer a few follow-up questions. Here are the main findings. For more details, my <a href="https://www.behance.net/mariepeter" target="_blank">Behance</a> is the right place.
                        <br>
                        Rewards
                        80% of testers understood at first glance what kind of content it should provide. That shows that a significant 20% needed more time.
                        Category name was changed to "Treats". A word that generate curiosity as well as a light excitement. The category name was validated by a round of A/B testing.
                        <br>
                        Health
                        60% of testers expected more informations as they would in a classic fitness app (calories burnt, recordings of the dog’s weight, diet, etc). 
                        <br>
                        Walk
                        80% of testers stayed inactive for more than 7 seconds, before identifying the "+" button as the way to create a new walk. In real conditions, the percentage of users dropping out would be probably high. It was necessary to fix this major issue quickly, as well as giving it more thoughts on a longer term. The schedule was
                        Short-term (1 week): 
                        <ul>
                            <li>move the "+" button to a more accessible place on the screen</li>
                            <li>add coach marks during the first use</li>
                        </ul>
                        Mid-term (2-4 weeks):
                        <ul>
                            <li>remove the coach marks (which I find a bit old school) and animate the "+" button with a tiny shake signifying "Hey! I'm there", if the user stays inactive more than 5 seconds</li>
                        </ul>
                        Long-term (4-8 weeks):
                        <ul>
                            <li>think again the core feature of the app "Walk"</li>
                        </ul>

                        It was clear that, as Mira said, the whole process of "planning a walk" didn't make sense. Other testers confirmed that they're always in the rush when going out for a walk and have their hands full already with the leash, the pooh bags, etc. Read : No hand available to take their phone out. 
                        In short, users shouldn't be asked to perform more tasks than... taking care of their dog. 
                        One way to be explored was to rely on localisation. Once enabled, the application would be able to follow the user and their dog during the walk and generate their rewards automatically. 
                        I decided to design a new prototype based on what I learnt during the usability tests. While I was at it, I found myself changing the UI completely and creating a new Design language for my app.

                    <h3>Refining the Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a new round of user interviews and prototype tests, it went clear that the core purpose of the Pup app had to evolve from a scavenger hunt (Gaming) to a pet-parenting assistant app (Wellness).
                        <ul>
                            <li>The colour palette evolved from a gaming vivid interface to an earth-toned and soothing palette</li>
                            <li>The primary persona being an Android user, the UI guidelines were changed from iOS to Android</li>
                        </ul>
                        The new screens were redesigned according to the Material Design guidelines:
                        <ul>
                        </ul>
                            <li>Buttons - Corners rounded,  25° radius changed to 4° radius</li>
                            <li>White/Neutral surfaces - Enhanced by the white background</li>
                            <li>Fonts - Avenir changed to Raleway</li>
                            <li>Iconography - Pictures over graphics for the prototyping phase</li>
                            <li>General balance - Blocks reduced to minimum</li>
                            <li>Content tone - Tabs title for the reduced features of the app (Walk - Treat - Health)</li>
                        I created a new mid-fidelity prototype, asked 3 peers to test it and iterated it accordingly. You can experience it <a href="https://invis.io/UKTMIJ8WDG5" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <h3>As simple as 1, 2, 3</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the Version 1, starting a new walk required 10 actions from the user:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open the app</li>
                            <li>Login/Sign in</li>
                            <li>Press “Let’s walk”</li>
                            <li>Press the + button</li>
                            <li>Press “Duration”</li>
                            <li>Select duration</li>
                            <li>Enable/disable localisation</li>
                            <li>Review itinerary</li>
                            <li>Validate</li>
                            <li>Start walking</li>
                        </ul>
                        In the new prototype, those 10 actions have been reduced to 3:
                            <li>Open the app</li>
                            <li>Press + button</li>
                            <li>Snap a picture and walk as you please</li>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!--close process section8-->
                <!--open conclusion-->
                <div>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>
                        Getting from 10 actions required down to 3 required to go through several Design Thinkings loops. 
                        <br>
                        But we’re aiming for zero steps. In a next version of Pup, the app could collect data directly from a smart collar, hence knowing when the dog is going on a walk and returning from it. It would save the efforts to login, activate the app and then the countdown, etc.
                        Knowing the personal informations of the dog (breed, age, diet…) we can imagine the app sending reminder when it’s time to pay a visit to the vet for yearly injections. Or even inform the parent that their dog is drinking more recently although the weather is not hot and they didn’t exercise more than usual. The app could ask the dog-parent if they change their food and recommend some wet-food for a while. Or inform them that this could be a sign of renal dysfunction, which is quite common for neutralised dogs of their age and breed.
                        <br>
                        In the future, the Pup app would no longer be restricted to the original concept “An augmented reality mobile game providing fresh and thrilling walking objectives to both User and Dog”. 
                        Pup would be integrated in a larger system as a pet-parenting assistant.
